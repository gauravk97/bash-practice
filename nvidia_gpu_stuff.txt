boot with old kernel

- check your /boot/grub/grub.cfg file and see if have an old version installed, but not active. otherwise https://askubuntu.com/questions/700214/how-do-i-install-an-old-kernel

- editing /etc/defaults/grub, putting something like this: 
  GRUB_DEFAULT="1>3"

- In my case grub.cfg has a submenu in the second part and the kernel to load was the 4 section. Remeber: In grub the sections start on zero (0) that's way i put the second section like "1" and the 4 section like "3": "1>3".
- finally run
  sudo update-grub
