boot with old kernel

For downgrade the kernel check your /boot/grub/grub.cfg file and see if have an old version installed, but not active.

In case you don't have one, you can install the version with your package manager utility (apt-get, yum, dnf, etc). see:

https://askubuntu.com/questions/700214/how-do-i-install-an-old-kernel


if you found an old one, only mark the versiÃ³n to use editing /etc/defaults/grub, putting something like this:

GRUB_DEFAULT="1>3"

This value change depending on your installation and updates. Check https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2, In my case grub.cfg has a submenu in the second part and the kernel to load was the 4 section. Remeber: In grub the sections start on zero (0) that's way i put the second section like "1" and the 4 section like "3": "1>3".

You could use an utility called "grub Customizer".

Be aware: If you don't make this kind of changes carefully, you can lost access to your server.
